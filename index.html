The source has Clock as the answer. Let's stick to the source's implied logic if it's tricky. The question does not specify mechanical clock. Sun dials etc are very old. Barometer (Torricelli, 1643), Cycle (1800s). Given options, and general "Clock" not "Mechanical Clock", 'Clock' is indeed very old.
                // Re-evaluating Q29 in source PDF: The options are (a) Clock (c) Barometre (b) Microscope (d) Cycle. The provided answer key (not shown here but assumed by user) would be needed to be certain of Imtiaz Shahid's intended answer. Mechanical clocks are ancient. Microscopes late 16th/early 17th. Barometer mid 17th. Cycle 19th. So Clock is oldest.
